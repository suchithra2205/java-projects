## Introduction

This project is a console-based version of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. It allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their markers either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If the grid is filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple console interface: The game is played in the console, with prompts and instructions guiding the players through each turn.
- Two-player mode: The game supports two players taking turns to play against each other.
- Win/draw detection: The game detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw, terminating the game accordingly.
- Error handling: The game handles invalid inputs and prevents players from making illegal moves.
